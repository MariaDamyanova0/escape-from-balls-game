#Escape from the Balls (Small Basic Game)

This is a simple game created with Microsoft Small Basic.  
The goal is to move your cursor around the screen and avoid the bouncing balls for as long as possible.  
Each level increases the ball speed, making the game more challenging.

- There are `10` colorful balls bouncing around the screen.

  - Ball speed increases.  
  - A congratulatory message appears.  

## Features
